# Fixed Persian Fonts

Most of free Persian fonts are not following TrueType/OpenType format properly. As a result, they are not displayed well in Microsoft Office for Mac and LaTeX. This becomes problematic when a document is rendered differently in Windows and Mac. This repo fixes Persian fonts to ensure Persian text in Mac and LaTeX are rendered similar to Windows. Before copying the fixed fonts, make sure to delete old fonts first.

** Note: ** This repo doesn't aim to fix other issues that these fonts have.
